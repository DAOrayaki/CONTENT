代币名称：DAO

代币类型：ERC-20

### DAOMaker 介绍及起源

        DAO Maker（DAO）**是一个代币化的创业孵化器和募资平台，旨在帮助去中心化应用程序（dApp）开发人员利用社交挖矿（Social Mining）的强大功能和无所不在的开采构建社区，然后通过项目的代币将社区转化为DAO的价值增值和价值评估成员。**

        DAO Maker通过向投资者提供风险债券以建立现金流，同时提供专家智慧来构建智能合约代币经济基础设施，包括协议驱动的销毁（burns），回购（buyback），股权激励（staking incentives），倾销罚款（dump penalties）和DApp中的其他机制，来帮助代币初创企业建立融资框架。投资者可以抵押ERC-20 DAO代币以获取独家SHOs（强持币人发行）。

        DAOMaker源于现任首席执行官Christoph Zaknun。在投资Bitcoin Cash获得收益后，开始将精力集中在建立自己的区块链开发上，从而推出了ICO Dog。在成功使用该平台之后，与Giorgio Marciano、Christoph共同创立了DAOMaker。在此之前，Christoph是一名医学专业的学生，曾学习机电一体化。同时，乔治（Giorgio）在软件和开发领域拥有16年以上的经验。今天，该团队由20多名成员组成。

### III. 治理和激励机制

        DAOMaker代币使其代币持有者能够获得治理收益，奖励分配（积极参与DAO Maker生态系统/ DAOMaker平台）和保持对DAOMaker生态系统的忠诚度。**对于DAO Maker开发的产品，代币及其可取性在获取及留存用户上起着关键作用。**

**III.1. dTeams**

        **dTeams是一种SaaS解决方案，可帮助代币化初创公司满足日常需求。**dTeams提供了防止腐败的基础架构，同时提供用于治理，抵押和保证安全流动性挖矿的设施，所有这些都通过具有内置CRM的经过测试的cPanel进行管理。它甚至为代币化初创公司提供服务并为愿意接受特定加密货币的人们提供工作和职业机会。dTeams是一款免费的免费增值产品，具有可通过DAO代币访问和支付的其他高级服务，只需支付占平台产生的交易量百分比的额外费用。

**III.2. 结构性融资**

        DAO Maker已为代币化初创公司筹集了超过3500万美元的资金，而这些受支持的初创公司现在的总市值已超过3亿美元。代币和股权企业均可以在 DAOMaker平台筹集资金，并提供强大的功能来支持各种形式的可退还和具有风险的产品。这样的筹资结构要求初创企业将大部分的托管资金交由第三方并由受保人保管。这些代管的资金可确保DAO Maker用户按照要求在指定时间段内完成退款。

**III.3.   可退款的强持有人产品 (rSHO)**

        大多数初创公司可通过公募进行最初的营销和发展社区。但是，大多数公募形式都无法实现这一目标。因此，**“强力持币人发行（SHO）”旨在建立一个社区，增加认同感，同时在某些情况下还通过严格的退款政策增强信心。**如果以可退还方式进行SHO，则一定比例的未退款资金会奖励给活跃的DAO持有人，帮助DAO Maker生态系统中的代币化初创企业成功构建（通过评估成功的代币化启动项目，成为DAO Maker社区的活跃参与者）

**III.4. 动态代币发行(DYCO)**

        DYCO为用于提供资金支持的代币产品提供新服务和框架，通过维持100％的代币循环供应来实现，由代币销售过程中筹集的部分资金支持。**DAO Maker通过受保人来保管这笔资金。DAO Maker平台的用户可以在指定时间段内发起退款。**此外，如果该项目通过DYCO并取得成功，则将未退款资金的一部分用于奖励生态系统，因为这些资金会被添加到DAO利益相关者的分配池中，从而为整个生态系统的积极参与者提供报酬，促进新公司的发展和社区建设。

**III.5. 产品介绍**

        **该平台要求缴纳一定比例的启动资金来促进DAO代币的进展，从而激励平台的增长和刺激用户忠诚度。初创企业可以选择支付DAO代币获取平台的高级访问权限，**特别是：

- 访问DAOMaker商业网络生态系统。

- 访问DAOMaker软件解决方案。

- 访问DAOMaker Premium研究报告。

- 与DAOMaker社区负责人接触。

**III.6.  DAO代币实用程序**

**1. 治理与奖励池**

        代币持有者有机会通过提案和发布提案评级来获得DAO代币及管理权。**参与治理允许stakers (质押者)可以接收来自平台的付款。**质押的DAO代币会被锁定一段时间，以确保长期的参与者加入。所有公司会使用一种或多种DAOMaker产品将其自有的社区带入DAO生态系统。活跃用户将能够（通过对最成功项目的评级）选出一枚代币，代币发放每月由DAO奖励金库支持。

**2. 高级访问**

        代币利益相关者还可以从分配优先级和激励措施中受益。当平台托管高需求产品时，高风险者将获得这些初创公司的优先访问权。**如果在DAO平台上出现超额认购的情况，则DAO代币利益相关者将被优先考虑，因为他们通过向自动做市商提供流动性和通过参与社交挖矿提供链下证明来证明其在链信誉方面的优势。**为用户提供了通过快速销售的DAO Premium高级帐户。DAOMaker的大多数产品都有巨大的需求，我们预计这种趋势会有所增加，进而转变向个人风险投资者提供更高安全性的系统。此次推出的加速去中心化计划，将进一步增加需求。自2018年以来，DAOMaker一直是代币治理领域的创新者，成为社交挖矿产品的核心。该产品早在2020年DeFi大热期间炒作治理之前就已经可用。

**3. 激励长期质押**

        为了使代币持有者能够参与治理，**对代币进行质押，确保具有远见卓识的人员参与到评估和评级过程。**当选项目会受到来自DAO和社区的帮助和服务。因此，用户质押代币，以确保他们有动机去分析和评估最符合DAO利益的项目。如果他们从事无意义项目，他们的份额将受到影响。DAO代币质押程序与大多数程序的不同在于，质押代币需要锁定一段时间。治理DAO生态系统的用户应是长期的受益人，并将避免任何危害社区的行为出现。质押代币的锁定期和归属权确保有兴趣对生态系统做出持久承诺的用户可以参与提案和评级。

**3.1. 激活期**

        发起认购份额后，持有人必须等待14天才能使份额生效。在14天的时间内，持有人无法参与治理，也不会获得奖励。

**3.2. 解锁期**

        代币解锁将有5天的冷却期。可以在5天后将代币从治理中撤回。中途可以退出，但需付费。即时解锁将收取明确的抵押费用（以DAO代币计），起始费用为所抵押代币的1％。费用每24小时减少0.2％。5天后，费用将达到0。任何明确表示取消抵押的代币都将会被销毁。

        该系统旨在鼓励对项目长久感兴趣的人员才能参与治理。 确保人们在价格波动期间不会大量买入或卖出，加剧波动。因此，质押系统旨在社区和生态系统的参与者内部建立承诺。

![](http://daorayaki.org/content/images/2021/05/1-21.png)**3.3 激励与报酬**

        平台建立了治理奖励金库，用于奖励和酬谢平台上的积极参与者，例如挖矿。每天将金库价值的0.5％用于此类激励和报酬。以向金库添加新奖励的示例为例，新奖励的前半部分将快速分发（大约5个月）。不过，后半部分将花费很长时间分配。这样可确保无论市场周期如何变化，金库都具有足够的奖励确保流动性。

        奖励金库旨在激励DAO社区参与者加速进入生态系统的新项目中。代币分发给所有成员去推动进入新项目，以此作为宣传的方式。用户可以使用这些代币来参与dTeam社交挖矿的治理及自动孵化过程中，而无需在交易所上购买这些新代币，有助于加速DAO程序进程。

![](http://daorayaki.org/content/images/2021/05/2-8.png)奖励分配曲线

**III.7.  强力持币人发行（Strong Holder Offering）**

        DAO Maker平台通过rSHO，DYCO等传统产品进行筹款。这些结构化的筹款系统可用于股权众筹和代币销售。rSHO是个例外，因为它将仅用于代币。rSHO允许项目使用DAO Maker筹款平台进行合规的公募，获得大量曝光，促进其建立更紧密的社区。最大的吸引力在于，rSHO激励DAO Maker社区的项目使用该系统。以防人们对TGE前6个月的进度感到不满意，则该机会可用于将募集资金的80％用于参与者潜在退款的项目**。为了创建一个积极的激励模型，DAO代币的利益相关者以rSHO加入的代币，则获得额外奖励**

**1. 分配**

        使用SHO的项目将在6个月内提供退款，如果以可退还的方式进行SHO，则要支付TGE的费用。项目有6个月的时间证明其在公开市场上的合法性。一般项目价格不低于初始购买价格的20％的，6个月后，只有不到10％的代币保持该价值。如果项目能做到这一点，则保留在DAO金库中以保护投资者的资金会返还公司帮助进一步开发，并将一部分用户筹集的资金用于从公开市场购买SHO代币并分配给DAO的参与者。以此作为成功的奖励，旨在激励DAO Maker社区中的所有参与者，帮助项目成为10％的那部分。如果该项目不成功，则将托管资金退还给最初的购买者。

        一定比例的未退款资金将用于在二级市场上回购该项目的代币。然后，这些“成功费”代币将用作金库，奖励DAO Maker平台上的活跃参与者。因此，如果一个项目运行了SHO，那么该项目的代币购买者寻求退款，则必然会退款。同时，如果做得好，买家不希望退款，将采用奖励措施（成功收取费用）。成功费用将用于购买项目代币，然后支付给DAO利益相关者，作为激励他们积极参与生态系统报酬的一种手段。激励了DAO利益相关者，促进生态系统中项目成功。因此，标题为“加速去中心化”。

**III.8. 平台费用分配**

![](http://daorayaki.org/content/images/2021/05/3-11.png)        来自Social Mining和dTeams的平台费用的一部分将用于购买加入DAO Maker生态系统中的项目代币。由DAO Maker平台推动二级市场购买，将为围绕小盘股的代币行动提供巨大机会。对于大盘股和小盘股而言，这也是一个强大的曝光机会。该系统激励加入DAO Maker生态系统的项目，有两个优点：

- DAOMaker社区曝光机会。

- 从价格和回购量中受益。

        DAOMaker的创建者希望通过创建一个支持流动性和曝光性的活动来激励项目使用各种DAOMaker产品，DAOMaker本质上表现出了生态系统项目的忠诚度。

        因此，DAOMaker增加了新用户购买DAO代币的转换率，使其在DAO社区中变得更加活跃。然后，这些用户被激活为持有人，并有资格进行定期投票，从而购买任意项目代币。由于代币持有者会获得奖励，对选定的项目提供资金支持，代币的成功也会使他们受益。这将为选定的项目提供强大的社区支持，从而进一步增加DAO Maker生态系统的价值。奖励金库清单将由平台参与者进行分析制定，每月进行评级，其评估力来自所抵押的代币数量（以保证在此类分析和评级过程中保证正确和诚实）。

**III.9. 忠诚度津贴（Loyalti Perks）**

        DAO代币的持有人收益将依据忠诚度津贴，投资的现金返还优先分配。

**1. 现金返还**：

        根据用户的份额，他们将分阶段获得现金返还，而该笔费用应从项目中扣除。例如，某人拥有500,000个DAO代币。他/她将符合忠诚度计划的第2层（T2）资格，平台费用提供65％的现金返还。

        假设此人以10,000美元的购买参与众筹，项目的平台费用（募集资金）为7％。该人不仅获得10,000美元的股权，而且还将获得最高7％费用的65％的现金返还。即10,000 * 65％* 7％，即$ 455。该人将获得所购股权的10,000美元，以及另外455美元的现金返还，作为股权的忠诚奖励。如果此人不质押而是仅持有代币，则所有级别的忠诚度奖励都会降低75％。

        现金返还系统一旦完成将启动，但尚未确定时间表。上面显示的数字和变量仅作为示例，可能与真实的现金返还系统有所不同。

![](http://daorayaki.org/content/images/2021/05/4-5.png)**2.  分配优先级**

        DAOMaker的DYCO和SHO产品已拥有巨大的需求，尤其是在小型public rounds中。对于超额认购的产品，DAO代币具有良好的信誉，质押是会被优先考虑。此外，用户可以通过以DAO代币向高级帐户预先注资并自动分配到产品中。 这意味着用户可以在之前预先分配资金。然后，这些资金将自动分配，而无需用户按时操作（自动分配快速通道服务）。

        此外，DAO代币使DAOMaker持有人获得优先权。项目在DAO平台上被超额认购，将会摇号。DAO代币持有者将获得更多号码。中奖号码被允许参加。SHO生态系统中的代币在分配优先级中发挥作用，但是分配的大部分将基于DAO代币的持有/抵押状态。

**III.10. DAO代币详细信息：**

        DAO代币将通过释放65％动态代币发售（DYCO）。代币还将通过收费桥（ toll bridge）确认归属。虽然TGE的标准分配是20％，之后连续四个季度每季度20％的方式，但DYCO参与者有机会通过支付通行费来提前领取所有代币。

**1. DYCO退款**

        DAO代币最初的价格为0.1美元。退款时间表设定为 距TGE的4、7、12月。

- 30％的已售代币将在4个月后以$ 0.065的价格退还。

- 40％的已售代币将在7个月后以$ 0.065的价格退还。

- 30％的已售代币将在12个月后以$ 0.065的价格退还。

        总的来说，这三轮退款加起来总计售出了DYCO下的所有代币。

**2. 归属和收费桥**

        收费桥按指定的智能合约将代币分配给买家。智能合约管理的三个分配方法：季度分配，收费桥销毁和收费桥索赔。

**2.1. 销售代币**

- 公开销售代币：在TGE完全解锁。

- 短期回合（short-term round）：TGE解锁20％，然后按季度解锁20％+收费桥。

- 长期回合（long-term round）：1年锁定，然后按季度解锁。

        收费桥公式= 100 = [(100 - x) * (0.75 * (360 - z)/360)) + 10*(z/360)]

x = 归属时间表

z =  TGE开始时间

![](http://daorayaki.org/content/images/2021/05/5-6.png)**2.2. 代币分配**

- 团队：1.5年锁定期，季度均值归属12.5％。

- 顾问：1.5年锁定期，季度归属12.5％。

- 基金会：2年锁定，其后每季度解锁14.28％。

- 合并与收购：5季度锁定期后解锁5％，然后在6个月后解锁10％，然后每两年解锁28.3％。

- 用户激励措施：3个月锁定期，根据平台使用情况解锁。

- DAO管理的基金会：12个月后解锁3％，然后4个季度释放5％，接着4个季度释放8％，再其后5个季度释放9％。

- 生态系统（社区）激励措施：12个月后解锁7.5％，随后每个月解锁2.5％

### **What does DAOMaker provide?**

DAO Maker (DAO) is a tokenized startup incubator and fundraising platform with the goal of helping decentralized application (dApp) developers leverage the power of Social Mining and omnipresent exposure to build a community, gain shareholders and convert its community of users to value-adding and value-assessing members of a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). DAO Maker helps token startups build a funding framework by offering investors venture bonds to establish cash flow, while providing expert insight to build smart contract tokenomic infrastructure, including protocol-driven burns, buybacks, staking incentives, dump penalties and other mechanisms within the dApp. Investors can stake ERC-20 DAO token to gain access to exclusive SHOs (Strong Holder Offering).

### 3. DAOMaker Governance and Incentive mechanisms:

The DAOMaker token enables its token holders to access governance benefits, reward distributions (for active participation in the DAO Maker ecosystem / DAOMaker Platform) and loyalty in the DAOMaker Ecosystem. The token and its desirability play a key part in user acquisition and retention for all current and future products developed by DAO Maker.

**a. dTeams:**

dTeams is a SaaS solution that helps tokenized startups with everyday needs. dTeams provides the infrastructure to prevent corruption, while providing facilities for governance, staking, and safe liquidity mining, all managed through a battle-tested cPanel with a built-in CRM. It even provides job and career opportunities to people who provide services to tokenized startups and are willing to accept specific cryptocurrencies. dTeams is a freemium permissionless product with additional premium services that can be accessed and paid via DAO Token, along with an additional fee that is a percentage of the volume generated on the platform.

**b. Structured Funding:**

DAO Maker has raised over $35M** for tokenized startups, and these supported startups now have a collective market cap of over $300M. The DAOMaker platform is a place for both token and equity ventures to raise funds, with the powerful facility of supporting various forms of refundable and risk-apped offerings. Such fundraising structures will mandate that startups provide a large portion of their raise as escrow, maintained in an insured custody. These escrowed funds ensure DAO Maker users can claim refunds within their designated time period, if requested.

**c.  Refundable Strong Holder Offering (rSHO):**

Most startups use public sales as a means to boost their initial marketing and grow their own community. However, most public sale formats fail to achieve this. Thus, The Strong Holder Offering (SHO) is designed to build a community that actively provides awareness for the company, while also inspiring confidence via a strict refund policy in some cases. In case SHO is conducted in refundable manner, a percentage of non-refunded capital will reward active DAO token holders for helping tokenized startups in the DAO Maker ecosystem achieve Success (via their active participation in the DAO Maker community of active participants by assessing and rating the most successful tokenized startup projects).

**d.  Dynamic Coin Offering (DYCO):**

DYCO is a new service and framework for money-backed token offerings, which is accomplished by maintaining 100% of the token circulating supply backed by a significant portion of the funds raised during the token sale. DAO Maker escrows these funds through an insured custodian. DAO Maker platform users can voluntarily claim refunds within the specified time period. Further, if the project achieves success via the DYCO, a percent of the non-refunded money is used to reward the ecosystem, as these funds are added to the DAO stakers' distribution pool, in order to remunerate the entire ecosystem for their active participation in the acceleration and community building of the new company.

**e. Product Introduction:**

A percentage of startup funding is claimed by the platform to further the progress of the DAO Token, thereby incentivizing platform growth and

user loyalty. Startups can opt for premium access to additional platform

services for payment in DAO tokens, in particular:

l Access to the DAOMaker Business Network Ecosystem.

l Access to DAOMaker software solutions.

l Access to DAOMaker Premium Research Reports.

l Access to DAOMaker Community Leaders.

**f.  DAO Token Utilities:**

**f.1. Governance and Reward Pool**

Token holders have the opportunity to stake DAO tokens and gain governance power through proposals and rating of on launched proposals. Participation in governance allows stakers to receive payments sourced from platform fees. Staked DAO tokens are locked for a period of time to ensure only participants with a long-term vision can join this process. Every company that will utilize one or several DAOMaker products will bring its own community to the DAO ecosystem. Active staking users will be able to elect a coin (via rating of the most successful projects), which will be supported by the DAO reward vault each month.

**f.2.Premium Access**

Token stakers also receive benefits in allocation priority and incentives. When the platform hosts high-demand offerings, stakers will receive priority access to these startups. In case sales are oversubscribed on the DAO platform DAO Token stakers are given priority as they have proven on chain reputability by providing liquidity on Automated Market Makers and off chain proof through participation in social mining. Users offered the possibility to fast track into sales via DAO Premium accounts that are paid in DAO tokens. Most DAOMaker offerings face massive demand, and we expect an increase in this trend as we shift to a system that provides even greater security to retail venture investors. The launch of the decentralized acceleration programs will likely add further fuel to demand. DAOMaker has been an innovator in the token-enabled governance space since 2018, as the Social Mining product was cored around this. The product has been available long before governance attracted hype during the 2020 DeFi explosion.

**f.3. Incentivizing Long-Term Staking**

For token holders to participate in governance, tokens have to be staked in order to ensure only people that have a long-term vision and are able to participate in the assessment and rating process. Elected projects will receive help and services from the DAO and community. Therefore, users stake their tokens in order to ensure that they have an incentive to analyse and rate projects that are in the best interest of the DAO. In case they continuously engage in harmful projects their stake will be negatively affected. The DAO token staking program differs from most in that staked tokens undergo a time lock. Users governing the DAO ecosystem should have a long-term, vested interest and will avoid any harmful behaviour. The lockup and vesting of staked tokens ensure only users interested in a lasting commitment to the ecosystem participate in proposals and ratings.

**f.3.1 Stake Activation Period**

After initiating a stake, holders have to wait 14 days for the stake to become active. During the 14-day period, holders are unable to participate in governance, nor do they receive rewards.

**f.3.2 Stake Unlock Period**

The token unlock will have 5-day cooldown period. Tokens can be withdrawn from governance after 5 days. Stakers who want want urgent exit will be able to do so, for a fee. An express unstaking fee (in DAO tokens) will be charged, starting at 1% of staked tokens for an instant unlock. The fee will reduce by 0.2% every 24 hours. After 5 days, the fee will reach 0. Any tokens claimed from express unstaking will be burned.

![](http://daorayaki.org/content/images/2021/05/1-22.png)This system is designed to encourage governance participation by only those interested in the project's longevity. It also ensures people do not bounce in and out of staking during price volatility, an act that only furthers volatility. Thus, the staking system is designed to build commitment within the community and ecosystem participants.

**f.3.3 Incentives and Remunerations**

Platform fees build up the governance reward vault used for incentives and remunerating active engagement on the platform such as social mining. 0.5% of the vault value will be used for such incentives and remunerations every day. Given the example of a new reward added to the distribution vault, the first half of the new reward will be distributed quickly (approximately 5 months). The second half, though, will take be distributed over a long period of time. This ensures the distribution Vault has adequate reward liquidity, regardless of market cycles.

The reward vault is designed to incentivize the DAO community to participate in the acceleration of new projects coming into the ecosystem. Tokens are distributed to all members to pull them into the new projects as a form of awareness campaign. They can use these tokens to participate in the governance and automated incubation process on dTeams and social mining, without the need to buy these new tokens on the exchange. This facilitates the acceleration DAO program.

![](http://daorayaki.org/content/images/2021/05/2-9.png)The reward distribution curve is calculated as

**g. Strong Holder Offering:**

DAO Maker Platform will offer fundraising through traditional offerings, rSHO, DYCO. These structured fundraising systems will be available to both equity crowdsales and token sales. The rSHO will be an exception, as it will be just for tokens. The rSHO lets projects use the DAO Maker fundraising platform to operate a compliant public sale, with access to massive exposure and the opportunity to seed a powerful community. The key attraction point is that the rSHO incentivizes the DAO Maker community to support the projects that use this system. This opportunity is be available to projects that offer 80% of the raised funds for potential refunds for participants in case people are not satisfied with the progress in the first 6 months from TGE. In order to create a positive incentive model, DAO token stakers will receive additional rewards in the form of tokens that join via rSHOs. However, the distribution of rSHOs will not be even.

**g.1 The Distribution**

The projects using the SHO will offer refunds within a 6-month period from the point of TGE in case the SHO is conducted in a refundable manner. The projects have 6 months time to prove their legitimacy to the open market. In case the project does not fall below 20% of the initial purchasing price. Less than 10% of all token sale maintain this value after 6 months. In case the project does achieve this, funds that were kept in DAO custody to protect investors are sent to the company for further development a percentage of the funds raised by token buyers is then used to buy the SHO coin from the open market and distributed to participants in the acceleration DAO. These rewards are a success fee designed to incentivize all participants in the DAO Maker community to help the project to become part of the 10%. In case the project is not successful the custodied funds are returned to the original token buyers.

A percent of non-refunded funds will be used to buy back the project’s tokens on the secondary market. Then these “success fee” tokens will be used as a Vault for incentives and remuneration to active participants on the platform DAO Maker. So, if a project runs a SHO, it is bound to give refunds if buyers of that project’s token seek them. At the same time, if it does well, buyers will not want refunds, an incentive (success fee) will be applied. The success fee will be used to buy the project’s tokens, and then paid to DAO stakers as a means for both incentive and their remuneration for active participation in the ecosystem. This incentivizes DAO stakers to have a reason to facilitate the success of ecosystem projects. Hence, this operation is titled “decentralized acceleration.”

![](http://daorayaki.org/content/images/2021/05/3-12.png)**h. Platform Fee Distribution:**

A portion of platform fees from Social Mining and dTeams will be used to buy tokens of projects that join the DAO Maker ecosystem. Secondary market buys powered by DAO Maker platform fees will pose great opportunity for token action surrounding small caps. It will also be a powerful exposure opportunity for both large and small caps. This system incentivizes projects to join the DAO Maker ecosystem to avail two benefits:

l Get exposure to the DAOMaker community.

l Benefit from the price action and volume generated by the buy back.

Creators of DAOMaker wants to incentivize projects to use the various DAOMaker products by creating a supporting event for liquidity and exposure, DAOMaker essentially shows loyalty to projects that become a part of its ecosystem. Thus, DAOMaker increases the conversion rate of new users to purchase DAO Tokens and become more active in the DAO community. These users then activate as holders, that are eligible to cast regular votes, determining which project’s token should be purchased. As token holders will be rewarded, it will be in their interest to offer support to selected projects, as the success of those tokens will benefit them. This will provide incredible community support to selected projects, further growing the value of joining the DAO Maker ecosystem. This reward vault listing will be analyzed by platform participants and rated each month, with rating power being derived from the amount of tokens staked (as an assurance to guarantee proper and good faith behaviour in such analysis and rating process).

**i. Loyalti Perks:**

Holders of DAO tokens will benefit from loyalty benefits ranging from cashbacks on investments to priority in allocations.

**i.1 Cashback**

Based on a user’s stake, they will receive a tiered cashback on the fee that is otherwise charged to the project. For example, suppose a person is staking 500,000 DAO tokens. He/she would qualify in tier 2 (T2) of the loyalty program, which gives 65% discount on the platform fee.

![](http://daorayaki.org/content/images/2021/05/4-6.png)Now suppose this person participates in a crowd equity offering with a $10,000 purchase, and the platform fee to the project (raising funds) is 7%. The person would not only purchase $10,000 of equity, but also receive a discount in the height of 65% of the 7% fee. That’s 10,000 * 65% * 7%, which is $455. The person gets $10,000 of the equity purchased, and an additional $455 in cashback as a loyalty bonus for staking. If the person is not staking and is just holding tokens, the loyalty reward is reduced by 75% on all tiers.

The cashback system will be initiated once finalized, for which the timeline is not defined yet. The numbers and variables shown above are only meant as examples and may vary from the cashback system implemented in the future.

**1.2 Allocation Priority**

DAOMaker's DYCO and SHO offerings have seen great demand, especially in the small public rounds. For oversubscribed offerings DAO Token stakers are given priority as they have proven reputability. Additionally, users can pre fund and auto allocate into offerings via premium accounts paid in DAO tokens. Meaning users are able to pre allocated funding prior to any listing. These funds will then be auto allocated without the need of the users to be there on time (auto allocation fast-track service). Furthermore, The DAO token will give its holders priority in DAOMaker offerings. case sales are oversubscribed on the DAO platform a lottery will take place. DAO token holders will receive more lottery tickets. Winning tickets will be allowed to participate in the sale. Tokens in the SHO ecosystem will continue to play a role in allocation priority, but the larger portion of allocation will be based on holding/staking status of DAO tokens.

**j. DAO Token Details:**

The DAO token will be sold utilizing a 65%-refund Dynamic Coin Offering

(DYCO). The token will also be vesting using a toll bridge. While the standard distribution is 20% at TGE and then 20% per quarter for 4 quarters, DYCO participants will have the opportunity to claim all tokens in advance by paying a toll.

**j.1 DYCO Refunds**

The DAO token was initially priced at **$0.1**. The refund milestones were set at 4,7, and 12 months from TGE.

l 30% of sold tokens will be refundable after 4 months at $0.065.

l 40% of sold tokens will be refundable after 7 months at $0.065.

l 30% of sold tokens will be refundable after 12 months at $0.065.

Collectively, the three refund rounds add up to all tokens sold under the DYCO.

**j.2 Vesting and Toll Bridge**

The Toll Bridge is enacted by the smart contract that distributes the tokens to buyers. The smart contract manages the distribution per three calculations: quarterly distribution, toll bridge burns, and toll bridge claims.

**1.1. Vesting sold Tokens**

l **Public Sale Tokens:** Fully unlocked at TGE.

l **Short Term Round:** 20% unlocked at TGE followed by quarterly vesting of 20% + Toll Bridge.

l **Long Term Round:** 1 year lock followed by quarterly vesting.

Toll Bridge Claim = 100 = [(100 - x) * (0.75 * (360 - z)/360)) + 10*(z/360)]

x = vesting schedule. z = days since TGE.

![](http://daorayaki.org/content/images/2021/05/5-7.png)**1.2. Total Token Distribution**

l **Team:** 1.5-year lock, followed by 12.5% equal quarterly vesting.

l **Advisors:** 1.5-year lock, followed by 12.5% equal quarterly vesting.

l **Foundation:** 2-year lock, followed by 14.28% quarterly unlocks.

l **Mergers & Acquisitions:** 5% unlock after 5-quarter lock, then 10% after 6 months, followed by 28.3% biannual unlock.

l **Customer Incentives:** 3-month lock followed by unlocks only per platform usage.

l **DAO-Managed Foundation**: 3% unlock after 12 months, then 4 quarters of 5% release, then 4 quarters of 8% release, and then 5 quarters of 9% release.

![](http://daorayaki.org/content/images/2021/05/6-5.png)l **Ecosystem (Community) Incentives:** 7.5% after 12 months, followed by 2.5% per following month
